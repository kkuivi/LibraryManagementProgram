# LibraryManagementProgram

## Overview
As part of a final class project I created a Java program, that acts as an interactive database for a library. The program has a CLI interface, that allows the user (a librarian), to accomplish common tasks like allow a student to borrow and return books. The program allows the user to search for books by title, author, and genre. Also the program allows the user to calculate fines for students with overdue books.

## Code
MainProgram.java is where the program is run from.
