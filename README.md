# LibraryManagementProgram

## Overview
As part of a final class project I created a Java program that acts as an interactive database for a library. The program has a CLI interface that allows the user (a librarian), to accomplish common tasks like allow students to borrow and return books. The program also allows the user to search for books by title, author, and genre. Finally, the program can calculate fines for students with overdue books.

## Code
`MainProgram.java` is where the program is run from. 

## Documentation
Documentation for this project can be found in `Documentation.pdf`.
